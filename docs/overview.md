# Project Overview

This is a management tool for students and courses at Tanzanite Skills Academy.

How it works:

- The backend (Node.js) handles the database and API.
- The frontend (React) is the dashboard where you manage things.
- We used TypeScript so the code is easier to read and has fewer bugs.
- There's a request logger so you can see every action in the terminal.
