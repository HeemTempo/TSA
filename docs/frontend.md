# Frontend Info

The frontend uses React and Vite. It's fast and responsive.

Key things used:

- React Query (TanStack): We use this to fetch data and refresh the UI automatically after changes.
- Tailwind CSS: For styling.
- Lucide React: For the icons in the UI.
- Axios: To talk to the backend API.

The code is split into components (like StudentList and CourseManagement) to keep it organized.
The styles are mostly in index.css and some utility classes from Tailwind.
